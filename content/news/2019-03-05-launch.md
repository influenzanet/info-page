**Bad News:**
Our long-established website [https://influenzanet.eu](https://influenzanet.eu) is currently down. Every administrative access including all the content seemed to have vanished into some mystical abyss. Hence there is only a very basic, preliminary site for now: [http://influenzanet.info](http://influenzanet.info)

**Good News:**
The design and construction for the all new Influenzanet - which we gave the very creative working title “Influenzanet 2.0” - has started and is in full motion. We just launched a first version of the page accompanying the development here: [https://influenzanet.github.io](https://influenzanet.github.io)
We emphasise “just launched” because it is just a start and we are planning to extend and update it dynamically from now on. We are very excited about the new system and want to share as much as possible with all of you - of course relying on your feedback, comments and contributions throughout the journey.
