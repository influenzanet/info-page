A modern system should be represented by a modern logo. We envision a friendly, recognisable logo including an icon which <!--more--> can also be used separately from the text and comes in fresh looking colours. Of course it should be easily used in monochrome and be in harmony with modern design concepts like material design with a primary and secondary color. Apparently it is not an easy task to bring all the logical, functional and taste based opinions or arguments in our team together to a single decision. We already went though a few feedback rounds and wanted to share the first serious drafts with you so you can join the logo party.
